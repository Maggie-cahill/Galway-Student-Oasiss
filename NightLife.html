		        <h1> Seven</h1>
			<p>Seven is an infamous cocktail bar which is right in the city<br>
               center. The cocktails taste amazing and the enviornment is <br>
				astouding. The light is not harsh and there's plenty of <br>
				comfortable booths to sit around with your friend's on a night out!<br>
				In our opinion it is one of the nicest bars to go to with your 
				friends.</p><br>

			        <h2> Busker Brownes</h2>
			<p>Busker Brownes is the main bar that everyone goes to. <br>
               It is packed almost every night as it is I think almost every <br>
				students favourite bar. It has good music, good drinks, and fun company. <br>
				If you want to meet lots of fun people and have an overall great night<br>
				this is the place to be.</p><br>

			        <h3> The Kings Head</h3>
			<p>The Kings Head is a beautiful bar in Galway City. It has two <br>
               floors and live music. The seating is comfortable and there's <br>
				plenty of space, so bring as many friend's as you like! <br>
				It can get quite busy and the music is loud so if you are looking <br>
				for conversation it might not be the place for you. It is definetly <br>
				worth a visit though a there's no bad things to say about it!</p><br>

			<div class="image-container" id="image-container4">
            <img src="anpucan.jpg" alt="Image 4" >
			        <h4> An Púcán</h4>
			<p>An Púcán is a lovely and fancy bar right in the center of Galway City.<br>
               It has an outdoor/indoor smoking area with fake grass covering the floor. <br>
				It is a bit pricey so beware but the enviornment is beautiful and <br>
				definetly worth a visit!</p><br>
			</div>
			
			<div class="image-container" id="image-container5">
            <img src="merlin.jpg" alt="Image 5" >
			        <h5> The Merlin Bar</h5>
			<p>The Merlin Bar is a small bar that is just down the road <br>
               from the Atlantic University of Galway. It is a nice place to go <br>
				even though it is not the most popular. It is small and generally <br>
				filled with older company, but it is nice for a quiet few and a chill night.</p><br>

			<div class="image-container" id="image-container6">
            <img src="sult.jpg" alt="Image 6" >
			        <h6 > Sult</h6>
			<p>If you go to college at or near the University of Galway <br>
               this is the perfect place to go! During the day it is a  <br>
				lovely cafe but at the night time itturns into the place to be, <br>
				with a nice lay out, high ceilings, and a wide range of drinks <br>
				to chose from it is by far a great place to go to especially location <br>
				wise if you are looking to blow off steam with a few friends after a long day of uni.</p><br>
